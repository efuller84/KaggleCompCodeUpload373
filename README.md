Product Recommender using Cosine similarity scores and overal product popularity to calculate the top 12 products a customer may purchase, evaluated using MAP@12 scoring.  This respository exists as a backup from an in-class kaggle competition, where my group placed second among 46 teams.  aryanshahu and Juntropy contributed to the project, assisting me both in data analysis and model testing.  See the Kaggle Competition report PDF for more details.
